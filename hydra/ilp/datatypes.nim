    ## * optional environment parameters that are used in constraints
    ## * a fixed number of variables grouped into a variable vector.

    ## 2 spaces are considered equal if the have the same label,
    ## the same environment parameters and the same rank (i.e. number of variables/arity in the value vector).

    ## * label B
    ## * no environment parameter
    ## * variable vector of rank 2
